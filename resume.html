<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="body_region">
  I am a software systems development leader, practitioner, and enthusiast. With over two decades of experience, I have been
  a part of many successes (and some interesting, informative failures) in building solutions and can apply those lessons to avoid the pitfalls and blind
  alleys that so many projects find. I have built several fault-tolerant and high-availability systems at scale, and have 
  a broad range of industry experience. 
  For the last decade I have been focusing on Banking IT systems, especially in the
  areas of data management, developer practice improvement, and architectural governance.

<div class="pos_desc">
  I am currently a Senior Vice President with the Citi Global Wealth Architecture team, after joining Citi with the Private Banking 
  Data, Reporting, and Analytics team.
  I initially built and led the Demographics Strategic Data team,
  successfully moving the Private Bank client database to a modern, scalable architecture
  available via easy-to-digest containerized APIs.
  More recently, I have been Product Owner for the Data Modelling Capabilities
  team and a member of the Architecture Governance team covering data concerns.
  I continue to assist the Data & Reporting team with navigating the highly
  regulated data landscape in Switzerland, as well as streamlining the
  Architecture Review Board to ensure we can continue to rapidly
  deliver in this environment.

  In addition, I am faculty of the Citi "Engineering Excellence"  program,
  which aims to inspire and grow the next generation of technologists at Citi.
<ul class="pos_accomplish">
<li>Delivered new Demographics service based on a Graph database</li>
<li>Delivered global real-time message bus for fast intra-day data transfer</li>
<li>Handle EMEA- and Switzerland-specific data security and regulatory issues</li>
<li>Streamlined Architecture review process for Private Bank data</li>

  During my last two years of work at Credit Suisse, I was
  a delivery lead for two Chief Compliance and Regulatory Office (CCRO) top initiatives, 
creating innovative solutions to enable compliant growth 
for the firm. I coordinate the technical team, approach, and integration for  
Negative News Screening (NNS) and Client Risk Scoring (CRS). In NNS, we are partnering with a vendor to bring
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to a formerly manual task, increasing consistency, efficiency,
and precision. In Client Risk Scoring, we are improving our ability to evaluate client risk by applying
statistical models back-tested against our big data platform. To support these initiatives at the Credit Suisse
  headquarters, in late 2016 I relocated to Z&#252;rich, Switzerland, and am currently learning German. Before
  that, I was tech lead for Credit Suisse's Digital Private Banking initiative for the Americas.
<ul class="pos_accomplish">
<li>Delivery lead for new Negative News Screening and Client Risk Scoring initiatives</li>
